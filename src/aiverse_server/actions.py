"""Operation primitives: the only ways players and AI change the world.

A primitive is a small immutable request, such as "move this resident to (x, y)". Players
send them by hand now; AI-driven residents will send the same ones later. `perform` checks
a request against the current world and either returns the next world or raises
`ActionRejected`, leaving the world untouched. Requests come from untrusted sources, so
every rule lives here rather than with the caller. Every primitive names the resident who
acts, and none goes through for a resident who has left or once the game is over.
